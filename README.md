![badge](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nield/036191e91ff7da1f940618f701c0ad9f/raw/badge_combined.svg?)

An example Minimal Api application with OpenAPI, Swashbuckle, and API versioning using clean architecture.

It also include the following: 
- Redis OutputCaching
- CorrelationId using HeaderPropagation
- OpenTelemtry with custom metrics
- Integration tests using Testconainters

This template is based on [Jason Tyler's Template](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture), but contains the list above and uses repositories in command handlers and different unit test and integration test setups.
